# MediaMix - The YouTube Recreation

### Note that:

- This project when run will take up port 3000 on 192.168.0.145 (router)
- The batch files are for development purposes. For people like you who may be using this code possibly for development, read the stuff below:

run.bat - Initialises the project, you can go on 192.168.0.145: whatever port you picked.
shutdown.bat - Shuts down the project in case it is still up when running.
xampp.bat - It opens up port 3306 for MySQL because I realised that Epic Games Launcher likes that port too.
